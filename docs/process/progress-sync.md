# Progress Sync Workflow

> Purpose: keep a lightweight repo-local recovery path when native Gstack or Superpowers context is unavailable.

## Source Of Truth

- `PROGRESS.md` is the canonical project status file.
- Superpowers specs/plans remain the source for design and execution detail.
- Gstack `/context-save` and `/context-restore` remain the primary save/restore path for session delta.

## Session Start Checklist

1. Read `PROGRESS.md`.
2. Read only the incomplete or recently modified `docs/superpowers/plans/*.md`.
3. Run Gstack `/context-restore` when available.
4. Read only the latest checkpoint from `.gstack-meta/checkpoints/*.md` or `~/.gstack/projects/OOTODAY/checkpoints/*.md`.
5. Read this file's snapshot only if native Gstack restore failed or checkpoint context is missing.

## Session Close Checklist

1. Update `PROGRESS.md` if stable project status changed.
2. Update any touched Superpowers plans so checkboxes match reality.
3. Run Gstack `/context-save` once per independently recoverable work batch, not for every micro-iteration.
4. Refresh the short snapshot below only as a mirror and fallback index.

## Checkpoint Writing Rules

- Keep checkpoints incremental: only record what changed in this work batch.
- Preferred structure:
  - `Summary`
  - `Verification`
  - `Open items`
  - `Refs`
- Target 15-30 lines per checkpoint.
- Do not restate project-wide background, already-shipped capabilities, or items already stabilized in `PROGRESS.md`.
- Archive superseded or duplicate checkpoints under `checkpoints/archive/` so default reading stays short.

## Latest Sync Snapshot

- Date: 2026-04-26
- Branch / theme: self-hosted analytics dashboard polish
- Latest checkpoint: `~/.gstack/projects/OOTODAY/checkpoints/20260426-003712-analytics-dashboard-polish.md`.
- Current blocker: no code blocker; analytics migration has been pushed and production env has `ADMIN_EMAILS`. Remaining validation is admin-account smoke in deployed `/admin/analytics`.
- Next plan to read: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-25-analytics-dashboard.md`
- Intended summary if `/context-save` fails: Polished `/admin/analytics` with DAU/WAU historical bar chart, fixed module display so Looks appears even with zero events, added Looks inspiration analysis started/succeeded/failed events, Looks funnel, Looks failure friction metric, and tests. Verification passed with `npm run lint && npm test && npm run build`.
