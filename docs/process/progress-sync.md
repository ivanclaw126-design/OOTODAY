# Progress Sync Workflow

> Purpose: keep a lightweight repo-local recovery path when native Gstack or Superpowers context is unavailable.

## Source Of Truth

- `PROGRESS.md` is the canonical project status file.
- Superpowers specs/plans remain the source for design and execution detail.
- Gstack `/context-save` and `/context-restore` remain the primary save/restore path for session delta.

## Session Start Checklist

1. Read `PROGRESS.md`.
2. Read only the incomplete or recently modified `docs/superpowers/plans/*.md`.
3. Run Gstack `/context-restore` when available.
4. Read only the latest checkpoint from `.gstack-meta/checkpoints/*.md` or `~/.gstack/projects/OOTODAY/checkpoints/*.md`.
5. Read this file's snapshot only if native Gstack restore failed or checkpoint context is missing.

## Session Close Checklist

1. Update `PROGRESS.md` if stable project status changed.
2. Update any touched Superpowers plans so checkboxes match reality.
3. Run Gstack `/context-save` once per independently recoverable work batch, not for every micro-iteration.
4. Refresh the short snapshot below only as a mirror and fallback index.

## Checkpoint Writing Rules

- Keep checkpoints incremental: only record what changed in this work batch.
- Preferred structure:
  - `Summary`
  - `Verification`
  - `Open items`
  - `Refs`
- Target 15-30 lines per checkpoint.
- Do not restate project-wide background, already-shipped capabilities, or items already stabilized in `PROGRESS.md`.
- Archive superseded or duplicate checkpoints under `checkpoints/archive/` so default reading stays short.

## Latest Sync Snapshot

- Date: 2026-04-24
- Branch / theme: `main` - Recommendation Engine Supabase migration alignment Phase 3
- Latest checkpoint: `~/.gstack/projects/OOTODAY/checkpoints/20260424-174000-recommendation-storage-migration-phase-3.md`
- Current blocker: recommendation storage migration is aligned locally but remote Supabase application is still unverified; App Quality workflow has not run on GitHub yet
- Next plan to read: `docs/recommendation-engine-handoff.md`
- Intended summary if `/context-save` fails: Phase 3 aligned `20260424143000_add_recommendation_preferences_feedback.sql` with recommendation read/write code, using `auth.users` FKs, `today` feedback context default, RLS own-row policies, and required feedback indexes; `types/database.ts` now reflects feedback id default; local `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` passed
